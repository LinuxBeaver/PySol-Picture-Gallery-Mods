# PySol-Picture-Gallery-Mods
PySol Solitare Game plugins

These are mods for the solitare game "PySol".
So far only a few mods exist relating to picture gallery type games. The only thing I did was swap a few lines of code to allow 
Picture Gallery to be played by alternative colors and any color but same. I also did this for a sister game of picture gallery 
named "Great Wheel".


To install you put the files in /home/USERNAME/.PySolFC/plugins and restart pysol.

for making a small, median and large version of Picture Gallery and whoever else made the game. As once again all I did was change a few lines of code to get Alt Color Picture Gallery going.
